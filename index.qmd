## Course Description

### Description
This course explores the use of artificial intelligence (AI) to address critical challenges in societal domains such as healthcare, education, environment, and public safety. It aims to provide students with a deep understanding of how AI technologies can be applied ethically and effectively for social good, drawing from cutting-edge research. The course will focus on both the technical and societal implications of AI-driven solutions, highlighting the unique challenges and opportunities in this field. We will study the latest advancements in AI techniques presented at top-tier conferences like IJCAI, AAAI, KDD, and NeurIPS, examining how these can be harnessed to create impactful societal solutions. 

### Contents
Topics will span a wide array of AI domains such as but limited to:

- Healthcare: AI for diagnosis, personalised medicine, public health monitoring, and remote care
- Environment and Sustainability: AI in climate modelling, pollution monitoring, energy efficiency, and conservation
- Disaster Resilience: AI for disaster prediction, response, and resource management
- Education: Personalized learning systems, intelligent tutoring, analysis of educational outcomes
- Public Safety and Security: Social engineering, AI for detecting misinformation, predictive policing

The AI technologies would include:
- Supervised Learning: Applications in classification and prediction tasks (e.g., disease diagnosis, fraud detection, poverty prediction)
- Unsupervised Learning: Clustering and anomaly detection for environmental monitoring, resource allocation
- Semi-supervised Learning: Addressing challenges with limited labelled data in social good applications
- Reinforcement Learning: Applications in resource optimization, healthcare interventions, and adaptive learning systems
- Natural Language Processing (NLP): Sentiment analysis, misinformation detection, speech recognition for social applications
- Computer Vision: Object detection, segmentation and classification for environmental monitoring, healthcare imaging
- Deep Learning: Use of neural networks for complex social problems (e.g., medical imaging, disaster prediction)


## Texts/References:

There is no prescribed textbook for the course. We will be following research publications appearing at AAAI, IJCAI, KDD, Neurips, ICLR, and similar top conferences or symposiums.
